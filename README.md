# IPL-Data-Analysis-2008-2024

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and competitive cricket leagues in the world. With matches spanning from 2008 to 2024, it offers a rich dataset for analysis. Understanding trends, performance metrics, and insights from this data can help teams, players, and analysts make informed decisions. However, the dataset is vast and complex, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights without a structured approach.

Objectives
The main objective of this project is to analyze IPL data from 2008 to 2024 to uncover trends, identify key performance indicators, and provide actionable insights into team and player performances. Specific goals include:

Identifying Title Winners: Determine the teams that won the IPL title each year and analyze their performance patterns.
Orange Cap and Purple Cap Winners: Identify the top run-scorers (Orange Cap winners) and top wicket-takers (Purple Cap winners) for each season.
Batting and Bowling Statistics: Analyze comprehensive batting and bowling statistics to highlight top performers and performance trends over the years.
Match Outcomes Based on Toss Decisions: Examine how toss decisions (choosing to bat or bowl first) affect match outcomes and overall winning percentages.
Boundary Analysis: Count the total number of sixes and fours hit in the tournament to understand batting aggression and strategies.
Team and Player Insights: Provide detailed insights into team performance trends, player career trajectories, and key contributors to match outcomes.
